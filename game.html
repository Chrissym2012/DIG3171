  <h1> Abstract </h1>

  
  <p>A Mother’s Sacrifice is an interactive narrative created in Bitsy where players step into the role of a mother determined to protect her child at all costs. Set in a minimalist pixel world, the game invites players to explore environments, uncover story fragments, and make choices that reveal the emotional and moral weight of parental sacrifice.
  <br>
  <br>
  By inhabiting the mother’s perspective, players experience firsthand the challenges, fears, and selfless decisions involved in safeguarding a loved one. The simple aesthetic of Bitsy emphasizes intimacy and emotion over complex mechanics, allowing the narrative to remain at the center. A Mother’s Sacrifice aims to immerse players in a poignant, reflective journey, showing how even small interactions can convey deep themes of love, protection, and personal cost. </p>
