  <h1> Abstract </h1>
  <p>A Mother’s Sacrifice is an interactive narrative created in Bitsy exploring the theme of parental sacrifice within a fantastical setting. Players take on the role of a child navigating through a small, atmospheric world filled with clues about their mother’s choices and the cost of protecting her family. Through branching dialogue and exploratory gameplay, the story highlights themes of love, loss, and the moral complexities behind selfless decisions.

<br>This project aims to immerse players in an emotional journey where each interaction reveals more about the sacrifices parents make, encouraging empathy and reflection. The simple, pixel-based style of Bitsy enhances the intimacy of the story, focusing on text and atmosphere rather than complex mechanics. A Mother’s Sacrifice demonstrates how minimalist game design can convey powerful literary themes and create meaningful, emotional player experiences. </p>
